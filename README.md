The project was carried out in MATLAB/Simulink with the objective of analyzing and comparing the performance of two widely used modulation strategies in power electronic systems. Separate models were developed for unipolar and bipolar control, where a sinusoidal reference wave was compared with a high-frequency triangular carrier wave to generate the switching signals for the full-bridge configuration. The simulated models enabled the observation of output voltage and current waveforms under both control methods, providing a clear understanding of their operational behavior. Further, FFT analysis was performed on the outputs of both schemes to evaluate the harmonic spectrum and quantify the effect of switching strategy on waveform quality. The study revealed that unipolar PWM provides reduced harmonic distortion and improved output quality, whereas bipolar PWM offers simpler implementation but introduces higher harmonic components. Through this comparative analysis, valuable insights were gained regarding the trade-offs between control complexity, harmonic performance, and overall efficiency in converter design, reinforcing the importance of selecting an appropriate PWM technique for specific power electronic applications.
